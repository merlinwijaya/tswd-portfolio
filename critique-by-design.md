# Critique by Design
## Step one: find a data visualization

I was searching "chronic illness" in Google when I encountered this visual. I chose this visual since I'm interested in global health-related data. Also, this is an interesting visual since I haven't encountered something constructed like this before. At first glance, it looks similar to the sankey diagram. After looking for a few more seconds, I feel there's not much insight I got from this other than most countries are predicted to have an increased number of diabetic adults. Since the visual labels showed the total numbers, I wasn't sure by how much the predicted number increased compared to 2019 data. I had to do the math in my head to know that. Futhermore, the top 2 countries are also the top 2 most populous countries, so it wasn't surprising. I felt intrigued to visualize the percentage change rather than the total numbers. I was curious how the rank would change.

## Step two: critique the data visualization
Using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile, here are my critiques:
a. Informative
    1. Usefulness        :6/10
    2. Completeness      :8/10 
    3. Perceptibility    :7/10
    4. Truthfulness      :9/10
    5. Intuitiveness     :9/10
b. Emotive
    1. Aesthetics        :6/10
    2. Engagement        :7/10

### Overall observations about the data visualization
Things that didn't worked well:
- The first thing that stood out to me was the big chunk of blue blocks. I needed to zoom out until 33% percent on my laptop screen to be able to see the whole visual. My thought is that they want to show comparison in an impactful way, hence the big blue blocks. However, this caused distraction and a lot of eye travel. This also caused the visual size proportions to be unsuitable for laptop screens where most people would access the visual.
- Another thing that I didn’t think worked quite well is the overlapping thinner lines that connect between 2019 and 2045p. These combined with the similar color choices for ranks 5-10, making it harder to trace how the rank moved between those years.
- Labelling both year as the total numbers of diabetic adults in each year didn't bring usefulness well. Audience at few glance can only catch that the most countries are predicted to have increase number of diabetic adults. 

Things that worked well:
- I find the country name and ranking labels worked well. It provides clarity and helps to intuit the visual well.
- I liked how it distinguished the below top 10 countries with dotted line. This is easy to intuit and perceive.

Things I would do differently are:
- I would change how the values on 2045P are displayed. Rather than showing the total predicted number of diabetic patients, I would show the number increase or percent change from 2019 to 2045. This would increase the usefulness and perceptibility because the audience doesn’t have to calculate in their head the changes. 
- I would reduce the size of the blue blocks to have more whitespace and reduce distraction. I would use a slope chart if I were to visualize that the total numbers since it gives a cleaner look, and this would increase truthfulness. It’s hard to compare the size between countries with the way it is. For example, in 2045, the size of the China and India blocks looks the same to me.
- I would label the data with percentage increase between those years, rather than displaying total numbers for both year.s
- I would change the color used. Blue is not suitable for this since it doesn’t bring the effect of an alert. I would use red. This would increase the audience’s engagement. 
- I would add the word “predictions” to 2045P. This will add points to the completeness.

### Primary audience
Healthcare Professionals, including doctors, nurses, dietitians, and other healthcare providers who need statistics and information about diabetes prevalence for research, treatment planning, and public health initiatives are the primary audience. This visual does reach the audience since they are interested in health-related data predictions. However, it will be more useful and easier to compare the changes between countries by showing a percentage change. Percentage change provides a clear understanding of the size of a change. Other than that, the amount of eye travel needed to digest the visual is also reducing the audience engagement because they might be reluctant to spend more than few seconds to look at the visual.

### Final thoughts on this evaluation method 
This method is successful since it covers both contextual awareness and design execution by breaking down both into several smaller categories. I find this is more useful and easier to use than the good charts matrix. However, it is easier to interpret the good charts matrix quickly. One measure I find missing is the measure to assess whether or whether people with disabilities can use visualization. This takes into account considerations for colorblindness and others. I would add this inclusivity measurement with scale 0 as noninclusive and scale 10 as inclusive.
