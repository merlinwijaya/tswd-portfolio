# Outline
> High-level summary of your project 

I’m interested in public health, including population mental health. I want to address the issue of suicide, especially in the young adults category. My story arc would include introducing the topic by showing suicide incidents for the general population and then highlighting the young adults category. Following that would be the underlying cause of those attempts/incidents which is the mental health condition. After that, I would bring up initiatives people did for this problem, including in the education, insurance, or policy sectors and their impact of them. I would end the story with calls to action for the audience as an individual and also to policymakers. My goal with this project is to address the issue of young adults suicide by increasing awareness and leading people to help. 

> In-class exercise for the story arc:
One-line summary: Bringing Awareness and Empowering Communities to Prevent Young Adults Suicide

As a reader, I want to know the underlying causes of suicide attempts so that I can understand the urgent need for proactive intervention and support.

Call to action:

I can do this by:
-	Spreading awareness about youth suicide and reducing stigma through education and conversations
-	Supporting organizations conducting research to develop effective prevention strategies
-	Being an active listener and reaching out to those in need, encouraging them to seek professional help

Policymakers can do this by:
-	Adding mental health conditions coverage in health insurance policies
-	Reduce access to lethal means among persons at risk of suicide
-	Adding mental health education in education programs

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Text here...

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first. 

I uploaded a copy of the data to my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZAqmYNhNKBN4cyEwy7CeuCTjJOoLUxdO?usp=drive_link).

# Method and medium
To complete this project, I plan to do:
1. Data Collection and Analysis: gather datasets from publicly available sources and do analysis.
2. Visual Building: visualize the data with Flourish.
3. Critique: ask for critiques for the visuals.
4. Medium Selection: use Shorthand as a medium where I would build my story arc. I would include visuals that I make alongside and description of the story.
