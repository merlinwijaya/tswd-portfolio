# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Heyy. My name is Merlin Wijaya (she/her). I’m originally from Indonesia. Currently, I’m a second-year graduate student in Health Care Analytics and Information Technology program at CMU Heinz College. I’ve been into working out and cooking lately.

# What I hope to learn
I want to work as a data analyst after graduation. From this course, I hope to learn:

1. Good chart characteristics.
2. Pitfalls in data visualization and storytelling. Also, ways to counter that.
3. Methods to make expressive and efficient charts.
4. Narate and present the chart with confidence and great flow.
