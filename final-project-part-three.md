# The final data story and Final design decisions
**[Final Data Story on Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/tswd-final-project-fall23/index.html)**

# Changes made since Part II 
1. Changed and combined the data from the previous pie chart and slope chart from part II to a scorecard visual for the Final Data Story.

Remove the pie chart that shows the percentage of public schools that offer At Least One Type of Mental Health Services and the slope chart for current solution implementation. Visualize the data using text, similar to the score card where the number is emphasized with a bigger font. The previous visuals caused confusion to the interviewees. I changed them to a scorecard that is straightforward so that the audience can get the idea quickly.

2. Added another visual showing the effect of the solution (school-based mental health services).

The common answer that I got from the interview is to show the impact of the solution. I added a new visual and placed it at the end to show that there is indeed hope in solving the suicidal problem and this solution has been studied to be effective in decreasing on decreasing mental health problems.

## The audience
The target audiences are:
1. School boards.
One of the solutions for the topic problem is to implement School-Based Mental Health Services (SBMHS). The main driver in realizing this is school boards. They need to understand the urgency of the suicidal behavior among the 15-24 age group so that they will make decisions to help. Those decisions can be about educational institutions’ curriculum, policies, and resources.

2. Policymakers.
Policymakers play a crucial role in advancing mental health initiatives. Their contributions can include endorsing laws and regulations that emphasize the importance of mental health education, awareness, and the availability of mental health services. Additionally, they can push for the allocation of more funds to enhance mental health support within educational institutions and local communities. Furthermore, they can allocate resources for data gathering and research to gain a deeper insight into the elements influencing youth suicide.
   
3. Parents.
Parents play a pivotal role in shaping the mental well-being of their children. A crucial aspect is maintaining an open and non-judgmental line of communication with their children, promoting a conducive environment for discussing mental health. Furthermore, parents should educate themselves about the signs of mental distress and potential suicide risk in young individuals. If they suspect their child is struggling with mental health issues, seeking professional help and support is essential.

4. Individuals.
We also have the power to make a significant impact on suicide prevention and mental health support. Empowering oneself with knowledge about mental health and suicide risk factors is vital. Understanding how to effectively support those in crisis is crucial in fostering a supportive environment. Additionally, individuals can contribute to suicide prevention and mental health support by getting involved with local initiatives through volunteering or making donations. Sharing information about mental health resources and crisis helplines with friends and family can also make a difference in promoting mental health awareness and support within the community.
