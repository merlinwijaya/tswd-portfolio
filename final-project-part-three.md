# The final data story and Final design decisions
**[Final Data Story on Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/tswd-final-project-fall23/index.html)**

# Changes made since Part II 
- Changed and combined the data from the previous pie chart and slope chart from part II to a scorecard visual for the Final Data Story.

I streamlined and merged the data previously presented in the pie chart and slope chart from Part II into a more straightforward scorecard visual for the Final Data Story. I removed the pie chart that showed the percentage of public schools offering at least one type of mental health service and the slope chart illustrating the current solution's implementation. Instead, I opted for a text-based scorecard format, emphasizing the numbers with a larger font to enhance clarity. This change was made in response to feedback from interviewees who found the previous visuals confusing. The goal was to create a clear and easily understandable presentation for the audience.

- Added another visual showing the effect of the solution (school-based mental health services).

In response to a common suggestion received during interviews, I introduced an additional visual to highlight the impact of the solution, specifically school-based mental health services. This new visual was  placed at the end of the presentation to emphasize that a viable solution exists for addressing the issue of suicide. It also underscored that this solution has undergone study, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing mental health problems.

- Added more transitional questions

I integrated additional transitional questions into the narrative. These questions serve to maintain a logical and smooth flow in the story, which enhances the audience's understanding and engagement. This design decision is effective because it acts as a bridge between different sections, ensuring that the information is presented in a clear and organized way.


## The audience
The target audiences are:
1. School boards.
One of the solutions for the topic problem is to implement School-Based Mental Health Services (SBMHS). The main driver in realizing this is school boards. They need to understand the urgency of the suicidal behavior among the 15-24 age group so that they will make decisions to help. Those decisions can be about educational institutions’ curriculum, policies, and resources.

2. Policymakers.
Policymakers play a crucial role in advancing mental health initiatives. Their contributions can include endorsing laws and regulations that emphasize the importance of mental health education, awareness, and the availability of mental health services. Additionally, they can push for the allocation of more funds to enhance mental health support within educational institutions and local communities. Furthermore, they can allocate resources for data gathering and research to gain a deeper insight into the elements influencing youth suicide.
   
3. Parents.
Parents play a pivotal role in shaping the mental well-being of their children. A crucial aspect is maintaining an open and non-judgmental line of communication with their children, promoting a conducive environment for discussing mental health. Furthermore, parents should educate themselves about the signs of mental distress and potential suicide risk in young individuals. If they suspect their child is struggling with mental health issues, seeking professional help and support is essential.

4. Individuals.
We also have the power to make a significant impact on suicide prevention and mental health support. Empowering oneself with knowledge about mental health and suicide risk factors is vital. Understanding how to effectively support those in crisis is crucial in fostering a supportive environment. Additionally, individuals can contribute to suicide prevention and mental health support by getting involved with local initiatives through volunteering or making donations. Sharing information about mental health resources and crisis helplines with friends and family can also make a difference in promoting mental health awareness and support within the community.

# Final thoughts
For the final data story, I managed to show studies of the effect of SBMHS. If I had more time, I would have included visual representations of SBMHS implementation on a state level and conducted a comparative analysis between two different states to identify the key factors influencing the effectiveness of SBMHS programs. Nonetheless, I am satisfied with the current version of my final story, as it effectively walks the audience through the user experiences and narrative arc established in Part I.
