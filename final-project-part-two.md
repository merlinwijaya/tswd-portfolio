# User research 

## Target audience
1. 15-24 year olds who are currently enrolled in school or have recently graduated.
This age group is particularly vulnerable to mental health challenges and suicide, making them a crucial demographic for this narrative. I would reach out to CMU students both undergraduate and graduate students that fall in this range.
2. Parents.
Parents play a crucial role in the mental well-being of their children. I would contact students in the master's programs at CMU who have kids.
3. School Board.
School boards are responsible for making decisions about educational institutions' curriculum, policies, and resources. I would approach by contacting Heinz education department.
