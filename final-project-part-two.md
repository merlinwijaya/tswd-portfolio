# Wireframes / storyboards

My narrative centers around Suicidal Behavior in Adolescents and Young Adults. It starts off by highlighting the rising suicide rates in the United States, particularly among the 15-24 age group. The urgency of this issue becomes evident as we delve into the breakdown of suicide rates by ten-year age brackets, with a clear emphasis on the concerning trend in this younger demographic.

This concern is further underscored by our exploration of the leading causes of death, where suicide ranks third among 15-24-year-olds. The narrative then delves into the relationship between suicidal behavior and mental health disorders. Notably, the 15-24 age group exhibits a high prevalence of mental illness. Fortunately, it's crucial to remember that suicide can be prevented, and one avenue to address this is by tackling mental health issues head-on.

The story discusses mental health education as a powerful tool to raise awareness and encourage individuals to seek help while dismantling the stigma associated with mental health challenges. For instance, school-based mental health services are a promising initiative in this regard. It's essential to recognize that suicide prevention is a collective effort, with many individuals already playing their part. We too can make a difference.

The story concludes by issuing a call to action tailored to various audiences, urging everyone to join the fight against this pressing issue.

# User research 

## Target audience
1. 15-24 year olds who are currently enrolled in school or have recently graduated.
This age group is particularly vulnerable to mental health challenges and suicide, making them a crucial demographic for this narrative. I would reach out to CMU students both undergraduate and graduate students that fall in this range.
2. Parents.
The influence of parents on the mental well-being of their children cannot be overstated. Therefore, reaching out to parents is vital. I aim to connect with students in CMU's master's programs who are also parents themselves, as they can provide valuable insights into the parental perspective.
3. School Board.
School boards are responsible for making decisions about educational institutions' curriculum, policies, and resources. I would approach by contacting Heinz education department.

> Final Thoughts
The current storyboards did pretty well in conveying the message and influencing the audience's emotions to care about this matter. Some visuals need additional adjustments. The interview definitely helped to ensure that the message was conveyed well. It also helped in pointing out things that didn't work well. It was interesting to get conflicting responses too between the interviewees.
